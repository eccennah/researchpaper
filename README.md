Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a neurological disorder which involves damage to the spinal cord, a bundle of nerve fibers that carry nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. 
While there are existing treatments for SCI, neuromodulation(a new emerging treatment) is looking to be more promising and efficient than others.  
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields have been shown to bring about multiple benefits such as increasing efficiency and quality by detecting errors and optimizing processes. 
The same can be predicted for the integration of artificial intelligence in neuromodulation for SCI. 
In this review, we will interrogate the use of AI to enhance the efficacy of neuromodulation in SCI treatment.
